My workings for [Learn You The Node.js For Much Win][learnyounode]. I'm using this to teach people node related things, so I thought I should do it myself to so I have a few good examples to refer to. They're also kind of fun. If you're trying to learn node right now, please don't just copy my answers, if you're really stuck maybe just have a peek for some inspiration but don't cheat.
